# Structured Email Extractor (Learning Project)

This project documents my learning process designing a structured data extractor using LLM-style system prompts and JSON schema validation.

The goal is to transform unstructured support emails into a clean, validated JSON format.

## Objective

Given a messy support email, generate a JSON response that:

- Follows a strict contract
- Uses controlled enumerations
- Handles missing data explicitly
- Separates structural validation from business validation
- Includes structured error reporting
